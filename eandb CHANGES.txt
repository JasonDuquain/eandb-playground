kwes:

<input type="text" name="name" rules="required|min:3|max:255">

If you want to add a custom success message just add
success-message=“This is a custom message” (this is an example)

the span that wraps each input, select, textarea, and button iside a form is: kw-field-wrapper along with incrementing numbers...kw-field-wrapper-1,2,3 etc.

to get the validation error to not mess up the layout add:

.kwes-field-wrapper .help {
    position: absolute
}

but may need to make .subscribe__field-prefixed is relatively positioned as well




i would think the modal_close buttons would need the noZenscroll class but they are working properly

use photoshop to darken it just a bit and maybe make a gradient from top to bottom that gets lighter as you go down since the text is at the top

update orientation MQ to not happen on desktop/laptop..BUT..

laptop 1280 x 570 so add some height queries are needed:

@media (max-height: 600px){
  //code for certain sects of laptop
}

and also some ipad/kindle styles and diff oreientations :)


fix the services modal(s) from scaling down to zero on page load!!

THIS WAS ADDED AND THE JS CLICK WAS REMOVED TO GET IT WORKING ON MOBILE EVEN WITH HTML HAVING SCROLL-BEHAVIOR: SMOOTH...THE SCROLL UP ON MOBILE IS NOT SMOOTH BUT IT AT LEAST WORKS:

<button class="js-btt-btn" onclick="window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })">
    <i class="js-btt-btn-icon fa fa-chevron-up"></i>
</button>


POSSIBLE TO LAZY LOAD THE SQUARE APP FROM LOADING RIGHT AWAY??
